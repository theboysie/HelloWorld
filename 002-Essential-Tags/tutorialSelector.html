<p id="FirstID">This is the first test at an ID</p>
<p>I am up to tutorial 67 of the HTML Tutorrial</p>
<p>A fun thing to do would be a big grid that I could tick that has how many tutorials I have done</p>
<p>However thinking about this, I would probably need a database of some sort to store the state of my progress as I change it</p>
<br>
<p>Another idea I have is a Star Wars comic Collection Tracker, just need to make sure that I keep these examples nice and chilled at first</p>
<p>As I am already thinking about how I could try to make this the engineering schedule of quantities website!</p>

<p>There is also the CSS Selector [] which can select an attribute like href or src in your CSS file and then it selects everything in the HTML</p>
<p class="centerguy">textalign: center</p>

<ol>
    <li>link</li>
    <li>visited</li>
    <li>hover</li>
    <li>active - and the acronym is LVHA live ha, this changes the thing that you are hovering over and stuff like that</li>
    <li>the thing about these pseudo class selectors is that you have to use :, i.e div:hover</li>
    <li>another propety is the cursor, which can go inside the selector statement, cursor: pointer;</li>
</ol>
<br>
<p>nth child + n is a way to select multiples of an element an application of this seems to be making a table</p>

<p>div p selects all p tags inside a div</p>
<p>div > p all p tags immediately beneath a div</p>
<p>div ~ p all p tags that are siblings following a div</p>
<p>div + p all p tags that are immediate siblings following a div</p>
